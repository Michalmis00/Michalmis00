# Hi there, I'm Michał Biel! 👋

### 🎓 Physics & Finance Student (PWr & UEW) | 🔬 Research Assistant (Optoelectronics) | 🚀 AI & Business Enthusiast

I am a dual-degree student bridging the gap between **Engineering (Nanoengineering at PWr)** and **Finance (Accounting at UEW)**. My goal is to apply analytical rigor from physics to solve complex business and financial problems.

Currently, I work as a **Research Assistant** at the Terahertz Optoelectronics Group, automating measurements and analyzing data.
